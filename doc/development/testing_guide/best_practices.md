#### SQL database

This is managed for us by the `database_cleaner` gem. Each spec is surrounded in
a transaction, which is rolled back once the test completes. Certain specs will
instead issue `DELETE FROM` queries against every table after completion; this
allows the created rows to be viewed from multiple database connections, which
is important for specs that run in a browser, or migration specs, among others.

One consequence of using these strategies, instead of the well-known
`TRUNCATE TABLES` approach, is that primary keys and other sequences are **not**
reset across specs. So if you create a project in spec A, then create a project
in spec B, the first will have `id=1`, while the second will have `id=2`.

This means that specs should **never** rely on the value of an ID, or any other
sequence-generated column. To avoid accidental conflicts, specs should also
avoid manually specifying any values in these kinds of columns. Instead, leave
them unspecified, and look up the value after the row is created.
